# Data Reporting for FPESA

## Project Overview

This project involves developing comprehensive data reporting solutions for FPESA, a fintech startup. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, I created a series of reports tailored to the needs of FPESA’s stakeholders. These reports provide insights ranging from daily to weekly metrics, supporting the clients and for data-driven decision-making across the organization.
#### Technologies Used
- SQL: For querying and extracting data from FPESA’s relational database
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations tailored for FPESA’s stakeholders
#### Features
- Daily and weekly reports providing real-time insights into key business metrics
- Customized dashboards that track transactional data, customer metrics, and other performance indicators
- Automated data updates to ensure that reports remain up-to-date

## Data Sources
The data for this project was sourced from multiple databases, including the main transactional database, customer relationship management (CRM) system, and various third-party APIs. I developed efficient SQL queries to extract, integrate, and consolidate the data from these disparate sources.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before generating the reports, I performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing. This included:
- Handling missing values: I used a combination of techniques, such as imputation and flagging, to address incomplete data points.
- Addressing data quality issues: I implemented data validation rules and cross-checked the data against multiple sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Transforming data into a standardized format: I normalized the data structures and harmonized the terminology across the different systems.
- Performing data enrichment: I supplemented the core data with additional context, such as customer demographic information and market trends, to provide more comprehensive insights.

The data cleaning and preparation process was crucial to ensuring the reports were based on reliable and meaningful data.

## Analysis and Reporting
Using SQL, I developed complex queries to extract and aggregate the data according to the stakeholders' requirements. I then leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that brought the data to life. This allowed the stakeholders to quickly identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.

The reports covered a wide range of topics, including daily transaction volumes, customer acquisition and retention, financial performance metrics, and operational efficiency. I worked closely with the stakeholders to understand their specific needs and tailored the reports accordingly.

## Sample Visualizations

Below are examples of the types of visualizations created for FPESA’s stakeholders. These include key performance metrics and trends, providing insights into daily and weekly activities.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

One major challenge was managing the large volume and complexity of data sources, which required a solid understanding of data models and careful mapping. Balancing diverse stakeholder needs with different reporting requirements taught me the value of clear communication and prioritization.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL, data analysis, and data visualization using Power BI. By delivering accurate and insightful reports, I provided the FPESA team with the data-driven insights they needed to make informed business decisions. 
The lessons learned from this project will continue to inform my approach to future data reporting initiatives.
